## by Nana H Musa

the lending pattern of the organization with key indices like Employment status, Term, Borrower rate and Borrower APR were considered during exploration stage. The data set can be found [here]( https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv)


## Summary of Findings

> The analysis of Borrower Rate and Consumer Income was derived from Prosper Loan, we extracted the necessary columns for exploration and no tidiness were conducted in the analysis. The graphical presentation of DSR implies that borrowers with high DSR rate have lower access to loan amount because they are considered high risk for investors. Also, a higher number of employed and full-time employment status placed against loan original amount shows a direct posisitive relations, higher BorrowerAPR is attributed to Other and Not employed employment status which makes it high risk. In conclusion there is a negative correlation between borrrower APR and Loan amount which is highlighted with a downward straightline slope

## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presentation I focused on understanding the relationship between Borrower APR with other variables and Borrower rate with other indices to determine loan amount that can be accessed by a customer
